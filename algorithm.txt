keep a freq list of english alphabets

find length
	for i in range(1, length(str))
		shift the array by i
		see which elements match
		store the number of matches in an array
	find the big numbers
	see how far they are apart (this is = length)
	return  length

find key
	for i in range(0, length - 1)(=range)
		take all str[i + range]

		find their frequencies ( = freq)

		for j in range(0, length of english alphabet)

			align freq(shifted by k) and englishFreq
			multiply the frequencies and sum them

		find the greatest sum
		store it as key[i]
